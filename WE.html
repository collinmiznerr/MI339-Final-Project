            <h3>University Edge Student Living, Lansing, MI</h3>
            <h4>Leasing Consultant June 2023 - Present</h4>
            <address class="place of work"><a rel="place of work" href="https://www.liveuniversityedge.com">University Edge</a></address>
            <p>In this position, I work as a leasing agent where my main task is to sell leases to all qualifying prospects to hit 100% at University Edge. To achieve this, I tour the potential primary resident along with their friends and family by showing them our amenity spaces, the property, and most importantly our model unit where they are able to see what it would look like if they lived there. I share my knowledge of property rates, initial, and monthly fees to help them get a good idea what they will be spending for the leasing term. I am able to answer any questions about the application process, co-signer responsibilities, move-in dates, pet policy, utilities, and any other general questions they may have about their lease. I also work with current residents with questions they may have about renewing their lease, ledger/payments, parking, packages and other general questions they might have throughout the year by phone call or walk-ins. I also perform market surveys to see what the prices are for our competitors around the East Lansing area.
